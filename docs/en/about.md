# About Varia Linux

## History

Varia Linux was born out of the author's habit of frequently recreating their development environment. While satisfied with the manual installation process using `pacstrap`, the author realized that automating the setup of a similar environment each time would be more convenient and efficient. This led to the creation of the Varia Linux `archiso` profile, effectively turning a repetitive manual process into a streamlined, installer-like experience for building the author's ideal daily-use system.

## Naming

The name "Varia" comes from the Latin word "varius," meaning "various" or "diverse." It reflects the philosophy behind the project: to create a flexible and adaptable system that can cater to a variety of tasks. While it is primarily tailored for the author's workflow, the name embodies the spirit of versatility that Arch Linux itself represents.
